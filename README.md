You have an environment, a PyTorch model, and an RL framework that are designed to work together but don’t. PufferLib is a wrapper layer that provide better compatibility between Gym / PettingZoo environments and standard reinforcement learning frameworks. You write a native PyTorch network and a short binding for your environment; PufferLib takes care of the rest.

All of our [Documentation](https://neuralmmo.github.io "Neural MMO Documentation") is hosted by github.io. @jsuarez5341 on [Discord](https://discord.gg/spT4huaGYV) for support -- post here before opening issues. I am also looking for contributors interested in adding bindings for other environments and RL frameworks.
